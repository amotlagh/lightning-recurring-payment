# What this do?
This builds a cron script and keysend script based on the options you choose. The resulting script will automatically send sats on a recurring basis to a node of your choice.

No sats are sent until you run the generated script or add it to your crontab. 

# How do?

```git clone https://github.com/amotlagh/lightning-recurring-payment.git```
